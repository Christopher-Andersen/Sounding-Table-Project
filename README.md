Variables:
HI_HT: Volume of the sounded innage rounded to the next highest innage value on the sounding table at the actual trim rounded to the next highest degree

HI_0: Volume of the sounded innage rounded to the next highest innage value on the sounding table at 0 degrees of trim

HI: Sounded innage rounded to the next highest innage value on the sounding table

HT: Actual trim rounded to the next highest degree

ST: Actual trim of the ship

LI_HT: Volume of the sounded innage rounded to the next lowest innage value on the sounding table at the actual trim rounded to the next highest degree

LI_0: Volume of the sounded innage rounded to the next lowest innage value on the sounding table, 0 degrees of trim

LI: Sounded innage rounded to the next lowest innage value on the sounding table

SV: Measurement taken from the sounding tape
